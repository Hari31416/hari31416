## ðŸ‘‹ Hello There!

I'm Harikesh Kushwaha, an M.Sc. student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD) with a deep passion for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). I thrive on exploring the vast possibilities of these fields and their application to real-world problems.

ðŸ§  My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in ML and DL algorithms, techniques, and frameworks. I have gained practical experience in developing and implementing ML models, optimizing performance, and analyzing large datasets. Additionally, I possess a good knowledge of finance and have undertaken projects in portfolio optimization and option pricing models.

ðŸ’» In addition to my focus on ML and DL, I also have a keen interest in web development. I enjoy building interactive and user-friendly web applications using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React.js. This combination of skills allows me to develop end-to-end solutions that leverage the power of ML and DL in user-facing applications.

ðŸ”¬ Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have worked on diverse problem domains, such as image classification, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and more. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and have experience with popular ML libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and scikit-learn.

ðŸŒŸ I am a strong believer in continuous learning and keeping up with the latest advancements in ML, DL, and web development. I actively participate in online communities, read research papers, and explore open-source projects to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the cutting-edge trends in these fields.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge in ML, DL, finance, and web development to develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams to tackle challenging problems and drive meaningful change.
